# Zoho-Hackathon
We got ev power usage datset from ODC public Domain -----> uploaded in the name 'Original Ds.csv'

We modified it using a python code ----> 'Modify.py'

Modified Dataset ----> 'Updated.csv'

We have an maps API key from GoMaps and assumed some places(mentioned in the code) to have the charging lender places ----> 'API.ipynb'

The updated map -----> 'Map.html'

Download c-hive_script.js, c-hive_style.css, c-hive_index.html and app.py on same folder----> open VSCode and run app.py , once the flask api gets activated ---> open the index.html file 

DQN model is trained for dynamic pricing ----> 'Dynamic_pricing.ipynb'

Download the maps.html and main.html and store it on same folder,change the path accordingly in main file ----> once done , open main.html ----> both the main.html and index.html would constitute an overall main page
